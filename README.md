### TopDown is my experiment
(Last updated 1/1/2017)

The main goals of this project is to hone my programming skills and to learn the necessary tools that often accompany programming, such as... git!

Developed on Linux.  Once it's more of an actual "game" and less of an experiment, I'll try to port it to Windows as well.

Current features being added (more or less in order):
- Finish grid-based proximity detection for more effection collision detection 
- Enemy spawning and direct-line "pathfinding"
- Level loading and dealing with multiple levels

##### Controls:
If you do manage to get this to run, as of writing the controls are:
- WASD to move
- Left Click to fire bullet
- Right click to teleport
- Q to spawn "enemy"
- X to clear all "enemies"
