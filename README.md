### TopDown is my experiment

The main goals of this project is to hone my programming skills and to learn the necessary tools that often accompany programming, such as... git!

Currently features being added (more or less in order):
- Quadtree implementation for more efficient collision detection
  - Currently having trouble with inserting
  - I'm also concerned about the performance of it, although I'm not terribly worried about it yet
- Enemy spawning and direct-line "pathfinding"
- Moving camera/level
- Making a level/figuring out multiple levels
