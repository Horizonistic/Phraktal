### Phraktal is my experiment
(Last updated 4/24/2017)

Forgoing perhaps necessary optimizations in collision detection, I'm now primarily adding new gameplay mechanics to make it more of an actual game capable of producing fun.

As of now, this has been developed on exclusively on Linux (like that matter so much with SDL2).  In the near future I intend to get SDL2 working on Windows as well.

##### Controls:
If the one person who reads this, actually wants to get it to run, and then proceeds to do so, as of writing the controls are:
- WASD to move
- Left Click to fire bullet
- Right Click to teleport
- Q to spawn "enemy" at pointer
- O to spawn an additional random "enemy"
- X to clear all "enemies"
- C to spawn a coin
- 1 to spawn a spreadshot powerup
- 2 to spawn a large shot powerup
- 3 to clear powerups
